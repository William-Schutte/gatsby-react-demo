# ADVENT(ur)
### A site for hypothetical travel company
### William Schutte, 2020

### Overview
Having mastered the fundamentals of React, I wanted to dive into more niche/secondary technologies like Gatsby, Styled Components,
and GraphQL. I created this page as a canvas upon which to experiment with these frameworks while I learn the ins and outs. 
This is simply a front-end page, no backend was needed.
